1) Before the GPS I was struggling with the basic ideas of adding and commiting...mostly the order
2) This concept was quickly clarified
3) I asked the guide about when we submit a URL if it was just the URL of the GitHub page
4) I don't know if there's anything that I'm confused about at the moment
5) The first experience was great, our guide was helpful and it was really good to work with someone else. I realized it is alot easier to work alone.
