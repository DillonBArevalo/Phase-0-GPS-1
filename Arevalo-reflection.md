* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I don't know that I was so much struggling with the concepts as much as just remembering exactly what commands do what.
I suppose you could say I was struggling with the idea of a merge conflict as I'd never seen one.
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
I got a lot more practice with good git and github workflow and I saw my first example of a conflict which was intuitive and pretty simple to resolve (I realize it was intentionally simple)
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
A lot of the questions I asked my pair were about specific commands and clarifying questions about what we were doing. Largely we asked our guide about things that were confusing in the wording of the assignment. We were good at doing our own research, but when we didn't understand the instructions we needed help.
* What still confuses you about Git?
I can't think of anything we've learned about thus far that confuses me with git.
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I really liked it! Ian and I worked well together (at least I thought so) and we were pretty efficient.
